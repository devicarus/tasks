**Tasks** is a self-hosted task manager for people who like their software simple, local, and under control.  
Built with a clean separation of concerns: an independent Kotlin backend and a responsive React frontend.

## ✨ Features

- 🧑‍💼 **Accounts** – user management out of the box  
- 📁 **Projects** – group tasks by context or area  
- ⏰ **Due ≠ Deadline** – distinguish when something should be *worked on* and when it must be *done*
